It's a  VB script to import execl sheet to genarate PDM tables,right now it's still need to change the sheet name by hand so the tables can be  import into PDM one by one.

The reason of that is I havn't learn VB script so far,next week i'll learn that so the code can be changed a lot bit beautiful.
